# React Burger Builder
Thank you for checking out this web app that I am currently building! This is a single page application (also mobile responsive) and allows users to virtually create a burger and order it!

## Frameworks, Libraries, Tools, and Concepts used:
- React Js
- CSS Modules
- Firebase
- Axios
- React Router
- Form Validation

## I will soon implement:
- Redux Js
- React Transition Group
- Ajax
- Authentication
- Unit Testing

This project allowed me to apply my skills in state management, react hooks, creation of modular components, to create a user friendly burger odering application!
